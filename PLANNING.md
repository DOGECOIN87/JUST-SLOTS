# Project Planning: Simple Slot Machine Game

## 1. Project Goal
To create a simple, web-based slot machine game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will feature three reels displaying images from a predefined set and a button to spin the reels.

## 2. Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
*   **Assets:** Provided `.png` image files.

## 3. Architecture & Structure
*   `index.html`: Main HTML file for structure.
*   `style.css`: CSS file for styling.
*   `script.js`: JavaScript file for game logic.
*   `PLANNING.md`: This file (high-level plan).
*   `TASK.md`: File for tracking specific tasks.
*   `README.md`: Project overview, setup, and usage instructions.
*   Image assets (`.png` files) will be in the root directory.

## 4. Key Features (Initial Scope)
*   Display three "reels" (image containers).
*   A "Spin" button.
*   On button click, randomly select and display one image asset in each reel.
*   Use the 9 provided `.png` images as the possible outcomes for each reel.

## 5. Constraints & Guidelines
*   Follow the workflow outlined in `Full Process for Coding with AI Coding Assistants.txt`.
*   Keep files under 500 lines.
*   Write comments for non-obvious code.
*   Update `TASK.md` as tasks are completed.
*   Update `README.md` as needed.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Out of Initial Scope)
*   Spinning animation for reels.
*   Win condition detection (e.g., three matching images).
*   Scorekeeping.
*   Sound effects.
